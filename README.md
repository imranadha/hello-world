# hello-world
A repository as a start to a new journey in life

Hello, my name is Imran. i was a dropout college student in Electronic Engineering. i quit because i got no money to continue my courses due to the pandemic that affected me and my family. i am a very big fan of programming and coding but could not find a chance to commit and study about them. i think this would be a great time for me to start and hope it could be a start of a new journey in life for me.
